# interactive-web-app
Inspired by [Python-engineer's](https://github.com/python-engineer/streamlit-demo) tutorial, I experimented with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) to build an interactive web app that can be found [here](https://ml-interactive-app.herokuapp.com/). 

This primarily demonstrates popular machine learning models using classic datasets. The project can also be used to compare various accuracy metrics and plot the confusion matrix for each type of model.
